    "I used many images of a chessoard taken from different angles and by finding their corners and ampping them to an absolute grid, we came to build a calibration matrix along with the distortion coefficients. Using these, we become able to estimate the distortion of our pinhole camera, and finally apply a distortion correction to next images.\n",

Since, it is provinding some input or intelligence to our algorithm, whether it can detect lanes and only lanes or it's easily biased by shadows and light variations. So here we tried to combine a bunch of all the filters we learned from the classroom. We applied a magnitude filter , a gradient filter on the x axis, a directon gradient filter and finally a thresholding on both saturation channel (HLS) and red channel (RGB).\n",
